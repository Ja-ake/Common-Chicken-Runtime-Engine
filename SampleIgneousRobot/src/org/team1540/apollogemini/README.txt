This is the Apollo Gemini project - an example of a fully functional CCRE
program, used on our robots last season.

It is not the epitome of good CCRE usage, but it should give you a good idea of
how to make working CCRE code.

To see a better example of good CCRE usage, see the org.team1540.apollogemini2
package.

This package is a separate project from the rest of the CCRE, but is made
available under the same license.
