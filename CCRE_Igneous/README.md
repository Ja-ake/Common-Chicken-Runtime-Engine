This is the Igneous extension of the CCRE.
It adds FRC-related functionality to the CCRE.
It will hopefully form the basis for all of Team 1540's FRC programming.

This system was conceived and designed by Colby Skeggs.
It is designed to work with Team 1540's CCRE project, which is the basis for this library.
