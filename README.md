This is the Common Chicken Runtime Engine core, Poultry Inspector, and Igneous system.
It will hopefully form the basis for all of Team 1540's robotics-related java programming.

This system was conceived and designed by Colby Skeggs.
The CCRE Core contains classes shared by all instances of the CCRE regardless of platform.
The CCRE Poultry Inspector is a standalone application that allows for inspection of Cluck networked objects.
The CCRE Igneous system is the system that allows for programs using the CCRE to run on the FRC-provided platform.
