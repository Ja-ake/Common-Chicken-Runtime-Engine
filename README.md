This is the Common Chicken Runtime Engine and all of its associated components.
It forms the basis for all of Team 1540's robotics-related java programming.

CCRE BRANCHES:
master: The main codebase. Almost always ready for use.
stable: A known-working version of the codebase. You shouldn't use this unless you really need a consistent version of the code.
ccre2015: The version currently being upgraded for the 2015 control system. Not useful right now unless you're a Beta team.

The old documentation can be found in DOCUMENTATION.MD under the SOURCE tab, but **you probably don't want this.**
